- **Fast Code Compiler**: Write, test, and debug your code swiftly with our fast compiler, providing immediate feedback for continuous improvement.

## Motive Behind CodeXF

CodeXF was created to address the common challenges when  we faced during traditional coding collaboration. Our aim is to:

- ** Reduce Screen Sharing ** : Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on screen sharing, CodeXF enables direct interaction with the codebase, making collaboration more efficient and less cumbersome
- ** Real-time Updates ** : Traditional software often lacks real-time updates, leading to version conflicts and delays. CodeXF ensures all changes are reflected instantly, keeping everyone on the same page
- ** Educational Tool ** : CodeXF is also an excellent tool for teaching code, allowing students to access and run code in real-time. This hands-on approach enhances learning and provides immediate feedback, making it ideal for educational settings.

## Getting Started

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account on through Google Auth.
2. **Create or Join a Groups**: Start a new Group or join an existing one.
3. **Collaborate**: Use our real-time editor and integrated communication tools to work with your team.
4. **Compile and Test**: Utilize our fast compiler to write, test, and debug your code.
